      "I wrote a [blog post](http://kbarre123.github.io/blog/2015/01/06/temp-sensor-analysis/) a few months back analyzing the DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensors that I'm using, along with an Arduino, to monitor temperatures during our beer brewing process. In the original post, I used embedded charts that I created using LibreOffice (or Gnumeric, I don't recall). The charts just .png files and are pretty much terrible. In this notebook, I will recreate those charts using [plot.ly](https://plot.ly) and expect them to be much better. "
